# Tony's Nutanix Samples

I wanted to create some scripts to start a Nutanix Cluster from a completely cold state.  I also wanted to be able to script the stopping of a running cluster back to a cold state.  Then I started working my way through each API available from Nutanix to create a working example of each one.

## How to use these scripts

- The requirements.txt file should have all the related python requirements.  I used python 3.7 and 3.8 to create these scripts but haven't checked against other versions.

- Update the  `.env` file with the correct info.
- 
For the rest you are on your own.
