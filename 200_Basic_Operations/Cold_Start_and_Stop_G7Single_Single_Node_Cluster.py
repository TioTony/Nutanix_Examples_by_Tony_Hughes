"""
This script can fully start or fully stop a single node cluster with a
single PCVM

The "Start" portion will start the node from a cold state using IPMITool.
It will start the cluster and boot Prism Central.

The "Stop" portion will shutdown any running VMs or alert if it cannot.
It will shutdown Prism Central, Stop the cluster, shutdown the CVM, and
use IPMITool to poweroff the physical node.

TBD:
- Add code to stop all running VMs
- Add code to verify PC and other VMs are all stopped
- Clean up/consolidate some of the variables and code
- Clean up formatting
