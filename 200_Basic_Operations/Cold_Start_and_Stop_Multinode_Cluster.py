# This script will prompt to power-on or power-off a multi-node cluster.
#
# It will not start or stop any additional VMs.
#
# Any other VMs must be manually started and stopped.
#
# This script requires the linux "ipmitool" and root access, although
# it will sometimes work without root. My use of it was inconsistent so
# I just included running as root as the default.
#
# This script is fully self-contained and does not rely on any other files.
